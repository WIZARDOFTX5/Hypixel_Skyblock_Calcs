Setting rng meter to handle from start, without kismets

VS:
Setting rng meter to handle from start, with kismets


![option1_nokismets](option1_nokismet.png)

So kismets is worth on f7 even after handle prices tanked


Only turning rng meter on when drop first handle without rng meter (with kismets)


![option2](option2.png)


Slightly worse than just setting rng on handle from start

Setting rng meter on only when it is 80% filled


![option4_730](option4_730.png)


Setting rng meter on only when 100% filled


![option4_914](option4_914.png)



> In conclusion, all these goofy strats are goofy. just set rng meter on from the start, with kismets.

weird strat: setting rng meter on til 80% filled, then off til drop handle, then on for second handle 


![option3_730](option3_730.png)


with kismets, by the time its 80% filled, we probably dropped the handle already, so ill try with switching it off after 250 runs
